Three one-sentence ideas the team might pursue for the project:

1.  Create an iOS app using Apple's swift, and highlighting the differences and
improvements of Swift versus Objective-C.

2.  Create an app with Scala that demonstrates some of Scala's improvements over
Java such as having closures and handling concurrent computations.

3. Modify Python to include allow the option to have type declarations in
variable and method declarations.
